In order to complete the task ordered, I tried to mimic "problem-solved-learning". I asked myself, everytime, "what should I do now, in order to get near of the goal?". Doing this, I have always had a clear sub-task to be completed. These sub-tasks were: "how do I upload datasets to Google Colab?", "How do I make a data structure from these folders?", "What neural network object to use?", "How to access the pictures from /test/ folder?", "How to classificate the figures in /test/ folder?", "How to rotate them?". Sometimes the next step were defined because the step before. For example, using fast.ai defined how to make the dataset and what neural network object I should use. Using some DropBox application defined how to transfer files between the platforms.
